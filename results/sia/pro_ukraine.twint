No 1 is worth trusting bc everything is meant 2take liberty.

He starred in romantic comedies &amp; as a high school teacher who becomes #PresidentofUkraine, in "Servant of the People."

1501810620093517826 2022-03-10 01:42:08 -0400 <ScorpioOx61> He seems a shoo-in but #Zelenskyy should NOT be @TIME’s person of the year… but the CENTURY! If only all politicians had a modicum of #Zelensky’s patriotism, selflessness &amp; courage, 3 qualities non-existent in most “leaders”, like compassion at #NATO and the cavalry in #Ukraine.

1501242772505964553 2022-03-08 12:05:43 -0400 <markdiffley1> Lovely round of applause in Parliament but I'm sure Zelensky would rather see some more concrete help with us accepting more refugees from Ukraine #Zelensky

1501263303997337613 2022-03-08 13:27:18 -0400 <AnfieldQueen> #Zelensky Such courage, such dignity. Humbling. We can learn many things from @ZelenskyyUa  I hope we can do more to help. @BorisJohnson watch and learn you utter weasel.

1502653037017501698 2022-03-12 09:29:36 -0400 <gbazov> It is quite reliable in terms of insider information from #Zelensky's administration. Very, in fact.

1502959457046831107 2022-03-13 06:47:12 -0400 <denis_pylypiv> What is the main difference between these three photos?   Vladimir Zelensky, unlike others, has a true family. And I think that exactly family, and Love between spouses, between a parent and children, to a large extent, makes him a man of heart who loves his  nation. #Zelensky  https://t.co/6swfWd3KOf

Understand his need to stay as #leader but can't we somehow move him to a safe place to prepare for future? I've answered my question already: he's a genuine and great leader. He won't go @mrjamesob @Channel4News

1501707989929312256 2022-03-09 18:54:19 -0400 <LennoxGina> 2/3 There’s a story going around that the press interviewed the #Ukraine President’s mother. And it goes like this: PRESS: Mrs #Zelensky, the whole world admires your son Volodymyr for his bravery and leadership. You must be very proud. MRS ZELENSKY: My other son is a doctor.

1501287704683634688 2022-03-08 15:04:16 -0400 <Rahmann_2> We empathize with the people of #Ukraine. #Zelensky's heroic struggle is a saga of courage and patriotism. He's inspired his people as all true leaders do in trying times. #Ghani fled the country with "big bags" of cash and proved that nationalistic jingoism is not patriotism.  https://t.co/Vpf651aLUp

1500984239466160131 2022-03-07 18:58:24 -0400 <parnellwrites> @SkyNews Great. Ask him why a nation of 44 million, blessed with abundant resources, couldn't get itself together and now goes round asking others to sacrifice while #Zelensky and his #oligarch backers plant money offshore like 17th century pirates.

1501252714180743168 2022-03-08 12:45:13 -0400 <SandraDNolan> #Zelensky speech to the House of Commons just now…he even quoted #Shakespeare &amp; #Churchill 💛💙 I don’t know how he does it. He is one of the most impressive leaders I have ever heard 🇺🇦 #SlavaUkraini I hope and pray his requests for help, military and humanitarian, are met. 🙏

1500352087112122368 2022-03-06 01:06:27 -0400 <s_anoopkumar> @jihadwatchRS It's simple my friend. #JustinTrudeau is taller than #Zelensky. Zelensky always felt he should have been few more inches taller to look like a hero &amp; a statesman &amp; not like a joker.

1500700565445169161 2022-03-07 00:11:11 -0400 <LoTooky> @JackPosobiec So you’re mad because #Zelenskiy was a star &amp; friends with rich people?  Wait, wasn’t President Trump also a star a friends with rich people?  No, you’re mad because #Zelensky did a better job at not alienating people.  Loved him but Prez Trump didn’t come to fame by being nice.

1503084026957115401 2022-03-13 15:02:12 -0400 <willowbeachbum> @afneil The more you see the more there is to like about #Zelensky I love how the full team are included, chefs, medics all.He just gets it and is one helluva leader, small wonder people are flocking to Ukraine to help.Most governments would still be debating if they deserved an honour

1501928832630079495 2022-03-10 09:31:52 -0400 <OlgaScherbina> @RealCandaceO - I think you will get the best performance of uncaring self-absorb character who laughs at #Zelensky &amp; what is happening in #UkraineWar. Imagining you looking at an image of wounded pregnant women on the ground of the bombed maternity ward in #Mariupol, smiling?

1501578729197289472 2022-03-09 10:20:41 -0400 <chillibeanboy> @KyivIndependent The West must ensure that Ukraine 🇺🇦 endures and wins.

All #Zelensky had to do was implement the Minsk Agreement and stop the shelling of #Donbass and this war would not have happened. Nonetheless, hopefully a negotiated settlement will be found.

1500658978308640769 2022-03-06 21:25:55 -0400 <RaviBatra> First, Pres. Volodymyr #Zelensky  went from a comedic past to war-ready #Churchill since - “I need ammunition. I don’t need a ride”; now, 🇺🇦First Lady #OlenaZelenska becomes an #AvengingAngel! I’m🇺🇸amazed at their infectious courage and so proud of both of them!   🇺🇦🤗😘❤️💪  https://t.co/qwBu32xSPd

She was a Kerrigan fan.  We have a lot in common.  Have followed you since Euros in 93.  You and #Zelensky are the ❤️ of #Ukraini #IStandWithUkriane

1501271214882500613 2022-03-08 13:58:44 -0400 <SheLLey4277> A true leader #Zelensky. A leader worthy of trust and absolute admiration.

1502211120240726018 2022-03-11 04:13:35 -0400 <GSexpanzer> Isn't it amazing that we are so quick to effectively canonise certain individuals like #Zelensky only for them to be pretty much the same as any other crooked politician? Named in the #PanamaPapers doing the old offshore tax dodge. Thanks @guardian  https://t.co/TV393jtEpf

1500839444382896133 2022-03-07 09:23:02 -0400 <Good_Bye_Earth> @christogrozev They are cocky to think Zelensky would bow like that after the last week. Deluded with political power is off the charts here. Zelensky is strong and unwavering. He is the best leader this world has seen! #Ukraine️ #Zelensky #brave

1502722048229101574 2022-03-12 14:03:50 -0400 <KirksSock> @RepBryanSteil Your party blocked #Ukrainian military assistance unless the grand orange wizard had #Zelensky do “a favor for him.”   Don’t you remember that, bry?

1501240689409077249 2022-03-08 11:57:26 -0400 <MarcoMRola> We're all waiting on #Zelensky to address the UK Parliament.  We've had our ups and downs, surely. Being south European, sometimes I feel extremely proud and privileged of having lived in England for a few years.  You rock.  Godspeed, #UK!

1500513117012377603 2022-03-06 11:46:19 -0400 <be_elzabozo> @AndrewYang Oh, yeah. #Zelensky has done a FANTASTIC job.🙄  Here's his new profile pic, inspired by how he looks &amp; acts whenever the U.S. State Dept./DoD knocks on his door.  https://t.co/ENspJAcz9Z

1501009316836429824 2022-03-07 20:38:03 -0400 <OnAgain1> If it looks like a crook, takes money like a crook, and hides money like a crook, there's a good chance he's a crook. #Zelensky

1501004267989217287 2022-03-07 20:17:59 -0400 <qualann> @ChristopherJM @scientificrealm It’s something when I listen to 8 mins of a language I don’t understand to hear the sincerity passion and intonation of a much respected Hero of our time #Zelensky #StandWithUkraine️

1500993085718814720 2022-03-07 19:33:33 -0400 <planetwatch2021> Remarkable bravery from #Zelensky. Now surely it is time for NATO to step up and stand up for Ukraine. #UkraineWar #NoFlyZoneOverUkraine

1501961822731227139 2022-03-10 11:42:58 -0400 <HammerSinghs> Can I ask how #Zelensky  was able to afford a $31 million Villa in Florida?  Was he a really good comedian, or a really really good President?  https://t.co/HMdoUt9pXV

1502388284881784842 2022-03-11 15:57:34 -0400 <Joelburg5> @DJIGlobal @DJISupport looks like a shipment of Mavic 3 drones would be well received in Ukraine. I'm sure #Zelensky will happy to provide shipping details.

1501453953753563138 2022-03-09 02:04:52 -0400 <CommonEnts> @thedailybeast I truly think #Zelensky should get the #NobelPeacePrize for defending democracy and calling for peace and diplomacy each day. He inspires all. As the underdog, he rose to the challenge and exceeded expectations.

1500641091577647105 2022-03-06 20:14:51 -0400 <petitderriere> Lol. Interesting piece. Sounded like it was written by one of those oversabi Uniport English graduates. #Zelensky from a comedian to a Churchillian collosus. Nice.🙂   https://t.co/8Y8Q54SMVr

1502753138335526917 2022-03-12 16:07:22 -0400 <pavlo_sushko> Now all of us have to be efficient in our routine as well.We must do our job one hundred percent, help colleagues,take care of our loved ones.  At the same time we must provide everything necessary for our defense.  For our defenders. This is a war for our independence.#Zelensky

1502154574357958659 2022-03-11 00:28:53 -0400 <DustyDuprel> In celebrating #Zelensky's courage and leadership, we overlooked the fact that our leader's first reaction was to help evacuate Zelensky and his family.  So, if our countries' positions were reversed,  we would have several runners. @tedcruz, @LindseyGrahamSC who else with you?

1501265382098620416 2022-03-08 13:35:33 -0400 <jodyfisher> @MollyMcPherson My first reaction is.. I want him to be my president. Or my client. He is strong, confident, determined. Everything you want in a leader. #Zelensky #Ukraine️ 🇺🇦

Watching videos of Ukrainian people so brave &amp; exhausted still having a sense of humor or willing to help in any way. I kinda remember when Americans were like that!

They will be a part of a Broadway show in Ukraine. A show was produced by Pentagon and directed by Biden. The main and real actor is #Zelensky.

1500667660878635008 2022-03-06 22:00:26 -0400 <icedcoffees> #Zelensky is a true hero, unlike the Republican Party!

1500323557456244740 2022-03-05 23:13:05 -0400 <balbir59> We've a standup comedian in Rahul, though his jokes are immature and stupid.  #Zelensky got an opportunity to get out of that role but became a puppet instead.  So comedians should come together and object to the invasion in the world of humour

1502083086384779278 2022-03-10 19:44:49 -0400 <Sun_teLiberty> More like we need to shut down #Parliament  they are all over paid deluded half wits! @wwwabbuzz They are all about massaging their own egos.

1500832221955035140 2022-03-07 08:54:20 -0400 <pendantry> @ZelenskyyUa  Dear Mr Zelensky, I am now following you to show solidarity with your cause against the evil that currently besets you. It's a small gesture – I wish I could do more. Wishing you all the very best in your struggles, and hoping that you are victorious! #Zelensky

1502019861765001230 2022-03-10 15:33:35 -0400 <Lex_Jurgen> #Zelensky was a mediocre to troubled leader of his nation. But then the invasion occurred. Big moments test people for better or for worse. And clearly he's shown the grit to be the leader his nation needs. We should be so lucky here in the U.S. with our top officials.

1503172490566279171 2022-03-13 20:53:44 -0400 <laflemm12> It's amazing how little #Zelensky loving liberals care about the right wing nationalists/Nazis in his past. Nor do they seem bothered by his frequent appearance in the #PandoraPapers  for using offshore accounts to evade taxes, despite his campaigning AGAINST corruption.

1503060576972402690 2022-03-13 13:29:01 -0400 <mightye123> Can we take a moment to give massive respect to #Zelensky for his courage and leadership. He left his bunker today to visit wounded soldiers in the hospital. Compare his actions to Trump’s and then ask yourself, who is the true patriot?

1502820698179641345 2022-03-12 20:35:50 -0400 <GaryMDean> Could Volodymyr Zelensky be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize? If so, then he should... Standing up for world peace as he is, no one could be more deserving.   #Ukraine 🇺🇦 I Vote #Zelensky #NobelPeacePrize

1501616281799196673 2022-03-09 12:49:54 -0400 <Anilkou84589070> Sir with great respect, you announced no longer insisting on NATO membership. Had you taken this decision 15 days ago, lots of lives could have been saved. What has you gained by this delay? Sir #Zelensky #TV9Bharatvarsh #zeenews #ABPNews #aajtak #JoeBiden

1500737948731510787 2022-03-07 02:39:43 -0400 <Enigma_of_Time> That story doesn't fit the narrative. #Zelensky must continue to be THE HERO. But he is corrupt &amp; has filthy riches &amp; no respect for his Jewish ancestors &amp; legacy. He cooperates mit fierce neo-#Nazis. This is the reality that media mogules are wanting to keep from everyone. WHY?

1503347254182219778 2022-03-14 08:28:10 -0400 <FitnessMamma> @me452020 Exactly what I keep thinking.  How do they think #Zelensky is good?? Just because he takes good #pictures dies not make him a good human.

1501242655870959616 2022-03-08 12:05:15 -0400 <Nervana_1> I’ve never seen a relentless, tenacious fighter like #Zelensky. Everyday he addresses lawmakers around the globe to secure support for his country’s right struggle. Kudos to @ZelenskyyUa 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦

1501171950646874113 2022-03-08 07:24:18 -0400 <BlankePit> I sincerely hope that - if Kyiv were to fall - #Zelensky will  have forces extract him and his team instead of becoming a martyr.  He's not only the greatest example of heroism but most of all the hope of the Ukrainian people and without hope all is lost. 🇺🇦🙏  #StandWithUkraine  https://t.co/1e0UuH0S9b

1500961642749870082 2022-03-07 17:28:36 -0400 <eyouelexchange> Mostly #Zelensky holding the people back. Everyone can support whoever they want but know the truth. If you want more understanding I’ll make a video. Support the people instead of the leaders who are forcing them to stay.

1500467204978008064 2022-03-06 08:43:53 -0400 <MarkGrayartfan> @JohnSimpsonNews Even #Ukraine media sources are checking this. The original source appears to be  #Zelensky adviser.

1501670565232402432 2022-03-09 16:25:37 -0400 <mostlyfactcheck> The best thing #Zelensky could do for Canada is inspire Justin to go back to acting. 🤞

While Finland did not defeat the USSR, it inflicted stunning losses, and was successful able to bleed the Red Army to the point Stalin accepted far less

1500429969763323906 2022-03-06 06:15:56 -0400 <annatolentini> #Zelensky, the famous Ukrainian comedian of yesterday and the hero of today in Ukraine: He proved to the whole world that the world needs leaders who are led by ordinary people because the world needs more courage and a smile than war and politics. RT Plz #Ukraine #ElonMusk  https://t.co/EWbTgkzlyv

1500869527281840134 2022-03-07 11:22:34 -0400 <laflemm12> But sure #Democrats keep on making #Zelensky a hero and BTW #Kolomoisky is one of the major funders of the right wing nationalists. Him they hounded #Burisma 's competitors. Let me see now, who worked for Burisma again?

1501620960427917318 2022-03-09 13:08:30 -0400 <MilneSeumas> This is funny, but the cost of this laugh could have fed a Ukrainian child for a day, send your money to #Zelensky

1501252627274899460 2022-03-08 12:44:52 -0400 <plantingforbees> Proposal to the HoC, to award #Zelensky an honorary knighthood, would be the first, in quite a while, that would be thoroughly deserved.  I do wonder, however, what he would make of the title.  'I don't need a title, I need safe skies/meaningful sanctions/refuge for my people'?

1501249391876878350 2022-03-08 12:32:01 -0400 <911Amelia> @DCBMEP It was an extraordinarily moving speech #Zelensky  ended it to "Слава Великобританії" - Glory to Great Britain. I still struggle (even now) to hear some MPs talking about the importance of democracy given their past actions against our own UK sovereignty.

1501692620740857859 2022-03-09 17:53:15 -0400 <khaasaamadmi> If countries have leaders like #JustinTrudeau or #Zelensky, it's so easy to push American stuff in those countries.  American industry lobby is so strong that these countries didn't even respect Trump as President, they simply obey the masters sitting in corporate offices!

1500706133215887361 2022-03-07 00:33:18 -0400 <Skyclaw4> Clearly. But he's just a puppet. The puppetmasters are the ones who are truly responsible. #Zelensky

The best thing for #Ukraine is someone neutral or even a military general take the control of #Ukraine and let #Zelensky perform his skills in #holywood if he is survived by then

President #Zelensky has shown poise, bravery and led those who need him most – his people.  There is a new high bar for #leadership - the 'Zelensky test'.  #Ukraine

1500554189834915843 2022-03-06 14:29:32 -0400 <oldcorps_USMC> I know he is a good guy because the people of Ukraine are taking comfort in his leadership.

Hope this is not a big mistake by him returning to his office. Being brave is one thing. Being stupid is another one.

1501264253671526403 2022-03-08 13:31:04 -0400 <JRMPRIEST> #Zelensky giving the first honest and meaningful speech in the house of commons probably for years. Wonder if any of them sitting there took note of what that actually looks like?!

1501320792096710662 2022-03-08 17:15:44 -0400 <bigdannyspencer> Don't know about you but I've never seen President #Zelensky and @Manics James Dean Bradfield in the same room. Both heroes, are they one and the same? You would almost like to think so.

However, the inclusion of so many right wing nationalists in the military and #Zelensky connection to #Kolomoisky should give pause to those who unthinkingly support the current Ukrainian govt.

1502441313148579840 2022-03-11 19:28:17 -0400 <Tenofee> I get why hardcore Trumpublicans (as opposed to the opportunists) are so down on #Zelensky. He's principled, brave, intelligent, articulate, and he doesn't wear a girdle and five pounds of orange makeup to go out in public. All the things Biff Bonespurs claims to be and isn't.

1501989214506090502 2022-03-10 13:31:49 -0400 <Naveen68597133> #Zelensky said "Together, we need to return to some Western leaders their bravery, so that they do what they should have done on the first day of this invasion” The bravery award/recognition goes to #KirilPetkov from #Bulgaria #JanezJansa  from #Slovenia  https://t.co/OqV0sAwGFT

1501601899832774659 2022-03-09 11:52:45 -0400 <ashishkibaat> I'm starting to think that #Zelensky during the #UkraineWar is more of social media marketing hype than anything else. Like NZ PM, Malala, Greta....  Have a feeling Ukraine's SM experts are winning this more than their soldiers on ground.

1502984448157040646 2022-03-13 08:26:31 -0400 <ammarhb87> I admire #Zelensky for his bravery though don’t appreciate him citing Palestinians as the aggressors, not cool.

1501021407991693314 2022-03-07 21:26:05 -0400 <SBarnart> So, Steve... What would #Zelensky do if their jobs were switched? What would this brave man do if he was Biden for month? I think... far more, far quicker, far more convincing, far more lives saved. There are pieces missing and Z would have them all.  Sad. @POTUS  @McFaul

1501624768545505282 2022-03-09 13:23:38 -0400 <ashokchavan19> @VitalikButerin #Zelensky completely destroyed his own country-Ukraine &amp; Ukrainians -children-people and the soles many soldiers. For what ? His love marriage to the western country. Ukrainians or blinded by this comedian and loosing their lives -homes for what? For nothing Crazy man……

1500589110934790150 2022-03-06 16:48:18 -0400 <NicholasRKent> Of course “thought leaders” are trying to profit off #Zelensky for their leadership seminars.   Your board room is not a war room. Plenty of leadership theories can be applied to businesses without invoking images of people trying to survive.

1501763878333870081 2022-03-09 22:36:24 -0400 <yodha_mike> @WarintheFuture The leadership of #Zelensky will be a case study.. an actor playing to his true potential in dramatics adequately fuelled by the West and supported by the massive IW campaign ..military leaders have to fight while political leaders look for opportunities to end the impasse..

I wonder if @VancityReynolds is available?

1500909179891957763 2022-03-07 14:00:08 -0400 <hersoftstory> @MattYoungCTV At least we aren’t being killed, at least our infrastructures aren’t being bombed. At least Canada has the privilege to maintain barriers of safety. If gas goes up because #Zelensky is defending #democracy - I’d say we have it pretty good and we must stay humble.

1501204607892131853 2022-03-08 09:34:04 -0400 <peter_boring> Just my take on this: 1) Pres #Zelensky is right to mention the #TalkBigActSmall of many countries. He is being offered "crumbs under the rich man's table", and he knows it. 2) Pres #Zelensky knows that all the🇺🇦 flags nations post will not stop a single bullet any time soon. 1/2

1500644332369494021 2022-03-06 20:27:44 -0400 <CurtisJefferySr> The more I study #Zelensky the more I realize he was instrumental in helping to get #Trump impeached! A nasty corrupt wee man he is.

1501387770526375938 2022-03-08 21:41:53 -0400 <JoeSmithSDK> FYI Obama/Biden funded Nazi's in Ukraine back in 2014 caused unrest just so the Nazi's could take the goverment #Zelensky is the front the people in charge are the military and they are very right wing Nazi. the media is trying to tell you otherwise but its true.

1502680151410290693 2022-03-12 11:17:21 -0400 <alessiaagali> #Zelensky wants to take Europe to war, even knowing that it would involve a great sacrifice of human life. Is this heroic?

1501739781189140480 2022-03-09 21:00:39 -0400 <sunetrac> Just as #Zelensky a former comic emerged as a leader the world adores, will we see #Bhagwantmann being embraced by the people of Punjab?

1500779064746983425 2022-03-07 05:23:06 -0400 <Fransfedup> #Channel4 are showing and streaming the hit Ukrainian series "Servant of the people" starring #Zelensky as the newly minted President.  Very dry but very funny. Everyone needs to watch it. I can absolutely see why he was voted in IRL to become the actual Servant of the People.

Afghanistan's president had given ur country to Taliban without any reaction and escaped but president #Zelensky stays &amp; defende h8s country &amp; people. Aren't there any differences from ur point of view?????

1500648580410920960 2022-03-06 20:44:36 -0400 <peter_boring> Certainly Pres #Zelensky is right that #sanctions are not an instant panacea. In the #RealWorld, politicians have done a lot of #TalkBigActSmall. Kind words, food and money. Some portable weaponry for anti-tank and anti-air use. But "kind words butter no parsnips"

1500902550656192519 2022-03-07 13:33:48 -0400 <StamatinaLiosi> Speaking as a deontologist. To the extent #Zelensky does what he (authentically) thinks that it is his moral duty, he is a true hero in this world.   Btw, the concept of #hero was lost in the post-WWII era of human rights.

1502163840737312771 2022-03-11 01:05:43 -0400 <NikMorgan10> That said, an adviser to #Zelensky told @anadoluagency that they considered the #Turkey talks to be a second leg of ongoing negotiations.  I think that speaks more to Zelensky's comfort with having Turkey in the room than an endorsement of its effectiveness at least so far.

1500312412704034819 2022-03-05 22:28:48 -0400 <dmac3kt> @Jerusalem_Post May the Precious Blood of #Jesus protect PM #Zelensky and his countrymen as did the blood of the lamb at the first #Passover protect the people from the Angel of Death.

1502319879877447683 2022-03-11 11:25:45 -0400 <RealMasterLong> Day14 #AmazingWorld In Day4, I posted a video about #Zelensky playing piano with his "#sausage".  That link doesn't work. I found a new one. He was a very good #comedian before he became #Ukraine president.  https://t.co/r6UylO8fXY

They are ok now,cowering, while #Zelensky bravely does what they were all too cowardly to do- face the despot squarely once &amp; for all, enough is enough!

1500747899801530368 2022-03-07 03:19:16 -0400 <ParuChirps> A lesson for all comedians to stick to comedy. Politics is not their cup of tea!   #Zelensky #UkraineConflict

1501290485356236804 2022-03-08 15:15:18 -0400 <Kaizen__8> Just as the warring parties were making concessions, and #Zelensky agreed #Ukraine️ would not join #NATO, #America &amp; #Poland are escalating tensions by supplying #MIG-29s.

A scoop would have included the outcome of the talks. Still interesting to see that #Zelensky seems to be thinking higher of #Schroeder than #Menyk does of #Scholz.

1501856792766291969 2022-03-10 04:45:37 -0400 <TokensDeals> The Global Times came out with a story about fascism in #Ukraine (see  https://t.co/nAYBmbksS1). The rhetoric is clear - "Nazis", "terrorists", "supported by #Zelensky's regime". #UkraineWar

1503148719402803203 2022-03-13 19:19:16 -0400 <Twitspice> @ChristopherJM Truly a great human. In the world that we live and it’s awful troubles we need the likes of president #Zelensky to reset the bar of decency and humanity.

1503147675511930885 2022-03-13 19:15:07 -0400 <ultimenotizie> Il presidente russo #Zelensky ha ribadito la sua richiesta di istituire una #noflyzone sull'#Ucraina o, ha avvertito, i "razzi russi cadranno sul suolo della Nato".

1503073065667739648 2022-03-13 14:18:39 -0400 <GetDianeFarr> The courage is just stunning  from #Zelensky to the 11 year old who travelled out alone - and every Ukrainian in between. #SlavaUkraini

1502455536675139598 2022-03-11 20:24:48 -0400 <LorenaDyson> #Zelensky is an opportunist, a man of drama and one who ultimately wants to be rich.

1501971553923342341 2022-03-10 12:21:38 -0400 <hagakure_jfp> Non bisogna dimenticare nella narrazione dei civili ucraini che restano "volontariamente"per combattere che #Zelensky ha vietato agli uomini da 18 a 60 anni di lasciare il paese. E questo provvedimento ha avuto un certo peso. Oggettivamente. #guerraucraina

1502077661300072449 2022-03-10 19:23:16 -0400 <bubba_wubba> It appears that #Zelensky has more respect for democracy than @CawthornforNC.  https://t.co/JyVj5hrBQH

1501718080153698307 2022-03-09 19:34:25 -0400 <justagirl2325> #Zelensky So impressed with his leadership.  Maybe we should elect more comics to be leaders.  Imagine North America with @jonstewart and @rickmercer.  Throw in @iamjohnoliver for UK prime minister.

1501249101383573520 2022-03-08 12:30:52 -0400 <DrewSmithUK> Incredibly proud of my @Zoom colleagues in the UK who worked round the clock to facilitate today's historic address to MPs from #Kyiv by President #Zelensky - the first foreign leader in British history to address @HouseofCommons #StandWithUkraine

1500470533686808578 2022-03-06 08:57:07 -0400 <PerhapsWriter> @Melanitaylor88 Other than perhaps Ashraf Ghani, I cannot name another leader in recent history who so absolutely &amp; irreversibly brought such devastation to his country &amp; its citizens.  Forget the excuses! Look at the RESULTS!  #Zelensky ran for president promising to bring peace to UA/Donbass!

1502029032375914498 2022-03-10 16:10:02 -0400 <APC_Justice> With "#woke" simply meaning:  informed, awake or enlightened - we're in a VERY dangerous, #Orwellian  place when powerful elected "leaders" like #GOP nutjob #MadisonCawthorn get away w/ demonizing knowledge &amp; enlightenment. #Zelensky   https://t.co/UAjtE3UXTA

1502643065432985601 2022-03-12 08:49:59 -0400 <MsCeeAngel> Oh no didn't you hear? The other Day.. PutPut was "Claiming" #Ukraine Gonna do #ChemicalWeapons on them via 🇺🇸 Helping them out. Even #Zelensky Pointed out he has a Family 👪 that he Cares ❤ about. Why would he even do that? He Called-Out Output. 😁

1502315389459513348 2022-03-11 11:07:55 -0400 <pianolisko> WTF?! #Zelensky is quoting #Kaczynski?! He's quoting a right-winged asshole that also treated their people like sh*t? That also supported and forced what's now going on in #Poland, Laws against #Freedom of Press, #LGBTQIA and stuff? #Ukraine

1500592006745182212 2022-03-06 16:59:48 -0400 <MucciNino> @MitraMotamed @Maryam_Rajavi People of #Ukraine or rather #NATO puppets like #Zelensky with his #Nazi Azov Battalion included in the Ukrainian National Guard and committing atrocities among the population?

1502660409467322370 2022-03-12 09:58:54 -0400 <cliveldunn> Be a good boy  #Zelensky! Keep #Ukraine fighting or we will hand you back to the #NeoNazis! You can negotiate all you want, but everyone knows that you have no value apart from as a figurehead.

1502834555576848389 2022-03-12 21:30:54 -0400 <urmann> @noblefacts It doesn't matter #Zelensky is the courageous leader that will be remembered by history.

1501019299527667713 2022-03-07 21:17:43 -0400 <Aryan_warlord> #Zelensky puts out video claiming it proves he's living in #Kiev on #Bankova street . This could be a case of well made CGI as well. The truth isn't clear .  https://t.co/lwyy8tlodb

1501493322485010435 2022-03-09 04:41:19 -0400 <hrh_hall> A strong and passionate leader, so the conspiracy idiots have started 🙄 saying something not right about him, digging into Ukraine history from years ago.

1502720462014590984 2022-03-12 13:57:31 -0400 <DimiTereres> Is it only me, or you too trust more a news platform when you know their political view, even when you are on the exact opposite side? At least more than the "independent" ones. #UkraineInvasion #Zelensky

1502492077543862276 2022-03-11 22:50:00 -0400 <thesirkadirov> One of the questions to our "great new government" headed by #Zelensky after the victory will be: "what the fuck are you and your "servants of the people" cooperating with the communist party of #China?" 🤮.

1501248531637706759 2022-03-08 12:28:36 -0400 <Mark05333851> #BorisJohnson hijacks the #Zelensky address to call for unity as the met findings loom. If ever there was a get out of jail card. Makes a rule break look like a tea party in comparison

1501250182805352448 2022-03-08 12:35:10 -0400 <Ryanjt4000> A mixture of pride, at the House of Commons standing in unison for #Zelensky followed by a sense that we are doing nowhere near enough. I’m reminded of Clapping for Carers, initial gratitude was quickly replaced by our government ignoring the existence of the pandemic!

1500719244828233729 2022-03-07 01:25:24 -0400 <siramrit> I think; ukraine president #Zelensky &amp; his advisers are working under USA interest not for the ukrainian people ! #UkraineUnderAttaсk

We're a tough brood. Tougher than you think.

1503154779471900672 2022-03-13 19:43:21 -0400 <4FoolDisclosure> @FoxNews @WhiteHouse grow some and support #Zelensky !!

It must be  a lesson for all those who gave their last full measure of devotion in #WWII to end such threats.

The UK should continue to support in the way we already are. (Baker) sounds like Starmer.

1501523933958483975 2022-03-09 06:42:57 -0400 <SaveUkraineSave> 🗣Zelensky urges #Poland, #US to decide on logistics of sending fighter jets to #Ukraine now.  “Listen, we have a #war! We do not have time for all these signals,” #Zelensky said. “It’s about human lives! We ask once again: Solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility.”  https://t.co/tGzc17zntN

I know the Govt is doing incredible work to help the people of Ukraine. You only need to listen to President #Zelensky to know that. And no anonymous twitter/TikTok troll will change that.

1502800252734259202 2022-03-12 19:14:35 -0400 <DarthApuReborn> Is that why #Zelensky the comedian is begging for Mig29s, begging for EU and NATO membership? Musing about having nukes?

1502321378007166981 2022-03-11 11:31:42 -0400 <Bart_Harkot> #Zelensky: Poles, Ukrainians and Belarusians should be brothers.  Together, we are 90 million. This alliance is not on paper yet, but is being made in our hearts. The President of 🇺🇦 understands perfectly well what his country is fighting for. What are we fighting for together.

1500909694554353664 2022-03-07 14:02:11 -0400 <AbeFucius> #Zelensky said he will never leave Ukraine. He is encouraging citizens to pick up arms to fight to the end. Rumours point to him fleeing to Poland. This is him trying to convince Ukrainians he is still in #Kiev. He can't find a room with windows or film outdoors? @SpiritofHo  https://t.co/Bx93eMsM8M

1500455923025862657 2022-03-06 07:59:03 -0400 <bardia54223742> Let's be honest. #West never trusted #Ukraine and never intrested to intergrate Ukraine in EU.  Even when #Zelensky won the presidential election, Western countries started to talk about twilight of #democracy.  And now i doubt it is possible to identify Ukraine as a #EU member.

1501643896333426693 2022-03-09 14:39:38 -0400 <StuartofLeeds> @MetroUK So, who do you think President #Zelensky is more likely to talk to? Grant Shapps or his own ambassadorr?  https://t.co/RTjHmihpUS

1501249736568881155 2022-03-08 12:33:23 -0400 <Yes_its_there> The matter of taking over or taking back #Ukraine has been no secret/no surprise. Electrocuting #JehovahsWitnesses has been just that. The actions of electrocutions are physical actions, NOT words that are voiced with sound, not physical harm.  #Zelensky has endangered humans.

1500562757506240522 2022-03-06 15:03:35 -0400 <Free_PatriotIII> It's been reported that Soros funded and installed #Ukraine president #Zelensky.  If ... *IF* ... that is true, why are you supporting Zelensky?  I don't know who to believe.  But I'm inclined to go the opposite direction when the #Democrats are pulling for one side.

1501947977195159564 2022-03-10 10:47:57 -0400 <Knightsatire> #Zelensky says; we needs a No Fly Zone now, Ukraine needs it now, we can't wait we're dying now. If you wait it will be too late for us. The West doesn't know how this will effect them but you can't live in fear bc of maybe's.  (Gist, not word for word)

1501313008605220867 2022-03-08 16:44:48 -0400 <Lyla_lilas> 5/ #Zelensky: Speaking in the British Parliament today, I remembered other difficult times.  Others, but similar.  1940  When tyranny threatened what she thought was a small island.  And she was sure that the island would not withstand the brutal blows.  Bombings.  And blockades.

1501980978776100865 2022-03-10 12:59:05 -0400 <HoliH1> When #Zelensky inevitably decides he no longer wants to do as the #USA says everything &amp; wishes to just take care of his country - as he should - I wonder what will happen? Will *we* abandon #Ukranians, like we did #Iraqis &amp; #Afghanis? 🤔

1502856770372481029 2022-03-12 22:59:10 -0400 <DarthApuReborn> So the solution is for Kiev to keep fighting, lose more lands, and or have #Zelensky removed from power. Sounds great.

1500463799605907459 2022-03-06 08:30:21 -0400 <cliveldunn> I get the feeling that #Washington is preparing #Zelensky's "exit" as his desire for surrender grows. They want someone who DOESNT care about the Ukraine's people. Make him a martyr and appoint someone more compliant to US wishes.

The lamb and meek may be loved by Western elites , but i don't think so about Punjabi society.

1501255751360290819 2022-03-08 12:57:17 -0400 <yasinhazar_> Giving President #Zelensky a standing ovation at the live conference is not a solution.  We know that later you will declare the dead Zelensky and the Ukrainians heroes and applaud their coffin. #Ukraine

1501898511612325901 2022-03-10 07:31:23 -0400 <GPS_SPINATO> #Zelensky ha fatto anche cose buone. Per esempio, rivoluzionare la fiction seriale che imperversa in Occidente, superando Netflix dal set mondiale con sacrifici umani del sequel di "Servitore del Popolo" che l'ha reso celebre. Restano da scoprire i costi e dove finiscono i soldi.

1500782098562621441 2022-03-07 05:35:10 -0400 <SebastienneL> @Teste84412446 @OWStarr He can't resign. He's not a coward. It's not a fair fight but he will defend his country &amp; the Ukrainian people to the end. 👏👏👏 #Zelensky #Ukraine  https://t.co/VKYUHGj27Z

1500779198318796803 2022-03-07 05:23:38 -0400 <coryjcass90> Well that’s weird. Also finding out soros places him isn’t the most inspirational news !!! VIDEO FOUND: Zelensky In High Heels and Perverted Dancing&amp;#8230;  https://t.co/9KXzX7iKdX #zelensky

1503154092406759424 2022-03-13 19:40:37 -0400 <SLOBODNASRBIJA4> It seems that the plan was to put #Zelensky to push the war outside #Ukraine but owners of gas and oil and weapon industry are so far so good, but Slavic and orthodox blood are on the field, and money of germans and france and uk out of pocket.

1500478918377488386 2022-03-06 09:30:26 -0400 <AbeFucius> @KevinRothrock Why are all recent vids of #Zelensky sitting alone in a room filming selfies? Is this normal for a Head of State? Despite his claims that he's still in Kiev, I have not seen any evidence to prove that. A simple video of him standing at a window with Kiev in background would help!

1503301390139015170 2022-03-14 05:25:56 -0400 <impaledgremlin> I am a brummie, English, British, European. But I have never felt such affinity to another people as I do to Ukraine and its citizens right now. Their will, spirit and fight is inspiring. Long live #Ukraine #Zelensky and all the #ukraineheroes

1500736269021810689 2022-03-07 02:33:03 -0400 <VivianaVivarel1> Abbiamo sentito in tv #Zelensky dire che ha ammazzato 10.000 soldati russi e ha vinto la guerra. Ma davvero l'intera Ue intende aiutare questo pazzo???

1502732674649182210 2022-03-12 14:46:03 -0400 <pink_lady56> I don't blame #Zelensky as much for corruption in Ukraine as I do Biden. Biden is Obama's puppet and Zelensky is theirs!

1500503987338031107 2022-03-06 11:10:03 -0400 <evilgirl2022> #Zelensky is a traitor. He knew what would happen if he joined Nato and choose to ruin his country and his people. I am sure that he won't be remembered as a hero.

They scrutinise him more than they did Trump. Never heard any 🇺🇦 say a bad word about #Zelensky 🇺🇦

1500469376079863813 2022-03-06 08:52:31 -0400 <alially1111> Why can’t Ukraine issue a ‘no fly zone’ over their own country?? Why are they waiting for America to do it for them?? #Zelensky is really pushing for WW3. I guess that’s what happens when you have #Soros backing you. 🤔

1502549411548835840 2022-03-12 02:37:50 -0400 <schimmelsven1> A must read: #Zelensky was asking #Trump for #Javelins (anti tank rockets that slow the invasion right now), but Trump was only interested in saving his own ass by finding dirt on #HunterBiden in #Ukraine️   Unbelievable.

1502178302550630404 2022-03-11 02:03:11 -0400 <mehran199> It must be said to #Zelensky: As much as you want to beg #America Your tomorrow is yesterday of Ashraf Ghani and Hosni Mubarak... #racism #Ukraine️  https://t.co/XH5yS7HBNR

1502090195591647261 2022-03-10 20:13:04 -0400 <justmy2coins> This is the filth who called #Zelensky a thug and then tried to clean up what he said after he couldn’t deny it

1502048997556592647 2022-03-10 17:29:22 -0400 <Lyla_lilas> 12/ #Zelensky:" Today and tomorrow, discussions continue in Europe about the future of Ukraine in the EU.  I believe that our people, our state, our army have already done everything to make people want to see us there."

1501605967766634498 2022-03-09 12:08:55 -0400 <thisisAppa> Ukraine president #Zelensky aka The Comedian or The Nazi?   I’m confused 🤯

1501556698363973643 2022-03-09 08:53:09 -0400 <asegpi> Unless #Zelensky is ready to surrender there is no reason to stay up here

1501474431713042432 2022-03-09 03:26:15 -0400 <LeapfrogMark> On #R4Today, @grantshapps states that #Zelensky wants refugees housed close to #Ukraine so that they can return. A convenient get-out for the overly-bureaucratic @ukhomeoffice and overly suspicious #UKGov. Shouldn't we concentrate on their safety first &amp; return logistics later?

1500691404246319105 2022-03-06 23:34:46 -0400 <lizzzyk66> 3 assassination attempts on #Zelensky over the last week. now ANOTHER attempt to assassinate VP?   When VP came to town where I live, huge train explosion just 5 minutes away from where she was.   I’m certain it’s all just a coincidence, as is this the home of Koch annual retreat

1500587845039308809 2022-03-06 16:43:16 -0400 <ERENBgis> In addition, #Zelensky gave orders to a number of local leaders.

1500487232427233281 2022-03-06 10:03:28 -0400 <AfghanBroadcast> And the #Ukranians want to say because their Prime Minister #Zelensky is of #Jewish #zionist background that it negates his ties to Neo-nazis or negates the idea of neo-nazis having infiltrated Ukrainian government. Isn't the Muslim Arab world &amp; West infiltrated by Zionist jews?

1500465967834361859 2022-03-06 08:38:58 -0400 <its_gauthamk> @potifar66 He may not, but #Zelensky  had the guts to stay and fight. That makes him a true leader.

1500427567110709249 2022-03-06 06:06:23 -0400 <Barbarasherlock> A deeply moving response to the collective crush on #Zelensky The man who said don't put up pictures of me in your office. Put pictures of your family and think of them every time you make a decision.  #Times columnist  @caitlinmoran sets her record straight.

1500752098237030401 2022-03-07 03:35:57 -0400 <masterchavin> @RWApodcast #SissyLensky #Zelensky a single life cannot be worth the same as thousands. and less if it has never been proven that he is in the capital. He should be out front protecting his people, not hiding behind them. 😈😈🐺

1503289747283890179 2022-03-14 04:39:40 -0400 <LennyReddy> No. E praticamente #Zelensky lo ha fatto intendere quando chiede la #NoFlyZone per evitare " incidenti" con la Nato.

The power hungry, misogynistic, white nationalist, fascist lunatics have essentially taken over Florida.  It's bonkers.  It's at the point that we need a #Zelensky type hero to come and bust up the corrupt cabal in Tallahassee.

1502982357082869763 2022-03-13 08:18:12 -0400 <Likhtam> Why worried #Zelensky ? Just tell your countrymen-  "ना कोई घुसा था, ना कोई घुस आया है" and play #Dafli That's it... #UkraineWar  https://t.co/uq5oGxAlrc

1502320679173058560 2022-03-11 11:28:56 -0400 <SaroyanDr> You’ll be amazed with how many more views your ‘shadow banned’ stories on the crisis happening in #Artsakh 🇦🇲gains when you add #PrayForUkraine  and #Zelensky 🇺🇦 to your stories as well as the #blueyellow color text schemes.

1502075078732877826 2022-03-10 19:13:00 -0400 <DomDellaValle> #Zelensky mi ricorda quegli uomini che vogliono per forza portarsi a letto una donna dopo che questa gli ha detto in tutti i modi di no. La #NATO, l'#UE, gli #USA, gliel'hanno detto tutti che non possiamo fare la #terzaguerramondiale per lui, ma lui insiste.

1500602881036242951 2022-03-06 17:43:01 -0400 <cachedillinger> The American left will cancel #Zelensky and #Ukraine in under a year. They headlock complex situations and then virtue signal to feel superior, only to abandon what they were protecting when it's no longer in fashion.
