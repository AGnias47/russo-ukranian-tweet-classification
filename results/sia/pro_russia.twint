Rumor is the people are very happy + rich. But be sure to have enough security to beat up kids who ask for peace. While lil Putin takes a dump on his golden toilet.  https://t.co/nPbYtWlnKz

Do you honestly think a super power country like #Russia won't survive?

1502103325080264707 2022-03-10 21:05:15 -0400 <KlubGP> Wow!!  These idiots at the #Kremlin actually did it! Yes, they had threatened, but this is amazing!!  Great news!! Making sure that business &amp; forgn co.'s that pulled out never come back to #Russia. Hope the sanctions last for minimum 20yrs+.  BACK TO THE STONE AGE!!   🗿🕯🛖

1501689600816918530 2022-03-09 17:41:15 -0400 <navellef> When in 2000 #Putin came to power he swore to 'protect and respect the freedom and rights of our citizens'. From that oath - one sentence - he breached🤥4 promises to the people of #Russia! He deprives them of protection + respect + freedom + rights.  And #Russians love it/him?🤦🏽‍♀️

The concept of freedom is different, though, as is the importance of the ’family’. Transparency and &amp; freedom of speech are getting better in China, but down in Russia.

It can be an authoritarian shithole all it likes. Just like all other countries can be open democracies if they like, join #NATO if they like and live freely if they like.

1501613617459965962 2022-03-09 12:39:19 -0400 <DCwatch16> I wish #Putin knew #Russia is a great country without having to conquer smaller, bordering nations, denying them their freedom. Beautiful churches and palaces. An Interesting history. A leading role in space exploration, and a place in today’s modern world.

Why does the US want to bind the @EU_Commission not to proceed as it likes in its foreign relations?

1502363824883580930 2022-03-11 14:20:23 -0400 <AliMakharesh> #Putin gained popularity when he focused on economy and #Russia was heading to the right direction running trade surplus with the rest of the world that the greatest economy in the world wish to run. That was with help of Germany, Holland and other European and Asian countries.

1501720082095001604 2022-03-09 19:42:22 -0400 <Wexboy_Value> Crazy thing is, I’d happily bet a huge % of US #tankies are funded directly/indirectly by #China, NOT #Russia...  ...so I guess their #usefulidiot support for #Putin is a weird free bonus to celebrate tht Russia was actually #communist decades ago!?!

1502716482505093125 2022-03-12 13:41:43 -0400 <techypz> @nexta_tv Yes!!! Go to #Russia then....to your homeland, so beloved by your beloved #Putin. And peace for all.

1502350021118865417 2022-03-11 13:25:32 -0400 <JasonMBrodsky> Translation: he really means #Russia but can’t say so. But whether Moscow will agree to support increased #Iran demands in the talks in exchange for Tehran’s support for its own guarantees is an interesting question to ponder.

1503271705262936067 2022-03-14 03:27:58 -0400 <Prof_TGSchulze> I hope that the West will start programs to welcome #Russia's great scientists.

1502330972699725824 2022-03-11 12:09:50 -0400 <HartRonhart> #Russia.  To survive as a super power you must have population growth. To have population growth you must be a country that people, especially smart young people, want to immigrate to.  That’s not Russia.  Russia’s days as a super power are over.

I’d love to read a history of this place if you’ve ever done one. Thanks for your great history lessons!

1501723476746379264 2022-03-09 19:55:52 -0400 <IchBinZerstorer> #Russia has attempted to become “stronger” but has basically succeeded  only in becoming a global joke. A joke we are all laughing at if not for their actual genocide of #Ukrainian civilians.

Russia literally acts just like the USSR, a socialist country, and they applaud them, yet they act like the US are socialists for mandating masks... Crazy. Like #Republicans would say, Move there if you love it so much.

1502680874499940355 2022-03-12 11:20:13 -0400 <democracy_16> The world loves Alexey Navalny hero forever in #russia and everywhere people yearn to be truly free   #breaking #love #wedding #SundayMorning

In the case of #Russia &amp; to a far lesser degree #Romania that could surely be a big improvement.

1501724838884380672 2022-03-09 20:01:16 -0400 <FixItWayne> What can America do to be more like #Russia, I ask myself.  The simple answer is partner with Russia and help the other nations be the best they can be.  #Leadership!  Give a hand up, to those who need it!

1503174537885720582 2022-03-13 21:01:52 -0400 <DarthApuReborn> Lmao #JohnBolton, who I used to be friends with a long time ago opines that #Putin wants to be a Tzar. He says this like it’s a bad thing. Nigga, if anything this makes me like #Russia *even more*. At least their values are based on natural law, not LGBT123 consumerism.

1502240526522798084 2022-03-11 06:10:26 -0400 <RobertPszczel> So #LeroyMerlin is not only staying in #Russia but proudly announcing increasing business there. Clearly its bosses are driven by greed and dispense with moral considerations. Not aware that doing business in Russia is not only ethically bad, but it is bad for your business...👇

1503105213632487424 2022-03-13 16:26:23 -0400 <masyou> Having internalized as he said #Russia's strife post USSR dissolution, he would've understood it's in nation's best interest to work on relations with the West. It'd be the rational incentive to move one into paying the price for long term prosperity &amp; peace in the country.

1502275753018368004 2022-03-11 08:30:25 -0400 <DorothyBeach> It’s a business decision. Staying in #Russia is still profitable. #DeutscheBankLovesTyrants and thank one is also vulnerable - the best kind.  All other bank made a business decision as well. Let’s not paint them as altruistic.

If Russia was more dependent on imports, then economic sanctions will have had *more* deterrence and impact. The EU should talk to Russia about EU membership as an incentive to peace

1502293128761466882 2022-03-11 09:39:27 -0400 <JVanderBrug> At least encourage non-NATO nations like #Moldova &amp; #Finland to request a #NoFlyZone over them as a preventative “airspace protection” measure to defend against future aggression, send #Russia a signal of strength (&amp; literally give those countries cover to join #NATO).

1502240470428094469 2022-03-11 06:10:13 -0400 <myelusivetruth> Rumour (@BBCWorld ) has it that #Russia will move to nationalise those companies that have shut down. This would mean seizing their assets, infrastructure in Russia. This is a strong move that may take, for example @McDonalds, by surprise.

That’s the only thing that makes any sense at this point, they just like to beat you down first to get the best deal. We can’t let them make a deal with #Russia

In terms of creating an EU army then it will make invasion a very costly adventure for #Russia.  If they go nuclear then all they'll get is an uninhabitable pile of rubble.

Nonetheless, he continues to win elections in #Russia -- bc of religious conservatives, imperial fantasists and those who thrive on corruption. Russia is no more innocent of Putin that #USA is of #MangoMussolini.

1502903931999072257 2022-03-13 03:06:34 -0400 <AndarthaRasri> Putin wanted to make #Russia great again.

1502871901433208832 2022-03-12 23:59:17 -0400 <intinnews13> I wonder if ' #climatechange ' was a nice way to tell #NATO people that enemies like #russia possess 'climate changers' and we aught not enable them.  All despots are the same. Sell you energy, or slave labor, use profit to buy nukes. Alt energy solves a lot of problems.

After a bounce of approx 7%, I will play for longs only if it sustains over 1st support levels of 16838 for 4-5 hrs.  1-2 daily closing below 16738 can take it again to 16000.

Implication is that whatever #Russia is asking for on the side is not in fact blocking agreement in #ViennaTalks.

The most likely people to be pro #Putin are Democrats! Russia gave Hunter Biden, Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton a ton of money for doing practically nothing!

1502568945538191362 2022-03-12 03:55:27 -0400 <MultipolarOrder> This does not mean that #Russia cannot fail, but certainly not because of #blitzkrieg, a term dragged into the debate without evidence. Bad information on this point might depend on three factors. Each of you can decide which one to give more importance to:

And is so reliant on #Russia oil &amp; gas (what "grown up signed those deals"?) the biggest sanction can't be done by #Germany especially?  So #EU $s for energy, effectively paying for bombs for #PutinWarCrimes

And in the meantime, #Russia is free of western cultural influences. This might make #Putin very happy.

1501488297281007619 2022-03-09 04:21:21 -0400 <Gianoia> The #sanctions against #Russia are right and shift away from #oil and #gas are urgent and right (climate change is coming!) but not because we pay for Russia's military. We pay for the middle and upper class' support for Putin and his #war.

1501794063229632512 2022-03-10 00:36:21 -0400 <amitashi01> OK, so while #TikTok and gaming companies sanction Russian children, Russian popular VK network showed doubling of video uploads, company income increased, VK cancelled fees for bloggers paying them 100% monetization! #Russia #sanctions

Otherwise we should not start - With such sanctions, we’d rather not stop on Ukrainian border. There is a solution: blow the whole world up. But not now. We will blow it up, definitely blow it up

The choice was not to remain or leave the EU, it was to side with one or the other.

They help by intro of additional problems: resentment to profiteers, control the black market, alternative power centres. But on its own will not work. Need military help as well. #NoFlyZone

In short, you already have a Kremlin imposed joint economic policy and it’s far from genius! #belarus

1501579008106196996 2022-03-09 10:21:48 -0400 <StephanEwald> My 2 cents to the #Thread of @AndrewWattEU. First a lot of people come to the conclusion due to media and pundits that the word is united against #Russia. It isn't. So plenty of opportunities for the Russian state and corporations to game the system. Our world is a big place.  https://t.co/EK5ra6Rw8w

1502651252798283778 2022-03-12 09:22:31 -0400 <AdoraLainey> I have a small concern that may be incorrect, but it’s there. If #Putin really wants to rebuy the USSR wouldn’t that also involve the need to remove capitalism &amp; western influences from #Russia? Did we just do that for him by encouraging all western businesses to leave #Russia?

1502638252997570560 2022-03-12 08:30:51 -0400 <fan_hongda> In the face of this situation, who is crying and who is laughing?  Do #Iranian negotiators agree with the report's determination of #Russia's responsibility? #JCPOA  https://t.co/JtGlivzNUY

1502777252999794692 2022-03-12 17:43:12 -0400 <LinoMazuran> @POTUS Only minor problems will be dead #Ukrainians but that is the sacrifice we are ready to take to get #Russia of the world stage as relevant party. Then we only need to focus on #china ;)

1502576834310942724 2022-03-12 04:26:48 -0400 <XOXO20211001> I'm not saying that military intervention is a good idea, but a state in which the  #UnitedStates declares ahead of time that it will not intervene militarily makes it easier for  #Russia to move.

1501919175006167040 2022-03-10 08:53:30 -0400 <trendingmkts> Why aren't western nations using this opportunity to "protect" their interests in the #Artic, given #Russia's attention and resources are elsewhere focused.  Given that 13% of the worlds #oil reserves are there, it would seem a no brainer ?

1501898929415274499 2022-03-10 07:33:03 -0400 <JapePuntila> @visegrad24 Considering the fact that #EU dependence on Russian energy has been growing steadily under the heavy EU sanctions slapped on #Russia after #Crimea invasion, this may not be bad for #Poland🤔 #sanctions #EU_Commission

1501762782328406019 2022-03-09 22:32:03 -0400 <DanielRashada> The only reason America and European nations don't confront #Russia militarily is nukes. Same goes for #China, #Pakistan, #India or #NorthKorea. That's exactly why #Iran wants nukes. You get nukes, you do whatever you want and not get fucked with. Period!

1503137988645212160 2022-03-13 18:36:38 -0400 <aj_observations> 2. If a deal is reached, it's important to note that #Russia is keeping to its original demands, so any final paper agreed will have to reflect them.

1503137763150946309 2022-03-13 18:35:44 -0400 <ArcadiusAquila> The big difference between #Russia, #USA and #China is that while all of them may lie to you, only the #USA has something resembling the #FirstAmendment and a profound, deeply rooted understanding of #freedom.  If you cherish freedom, there still is no substitute for the USA.

1501947275290890244 2022-03-10 10:45:09 -0400 <j90w1> @nexta_tv Yes, #Russia please turn off Gas and Oil we will suffer a lot :D don't think that you would do us a service ( all do it will be a high favore if you turn it off)

1503174793012654080 2022-03-13 21:02:52 -0400 <TrumpBestraysUS> @dkxkee @RawStory #Putin loves how he has compromised puppet #Trump and the Trump band of compromised #GOPtraitors destroying American democracy and praising him on right wing media. What more could #Putin want? He pulls their strings, and they dance. How much #Russia oil money is he paying them?  https://t.co/lxwVU4buQS

1501946280611762182 2022-03-10 10:41:12 -0400 <PutinIsAVirus> IMO the moment is now. While theoretically #russia has intelligence means well beyond those of #osint accounts on twitter, news entities etc, what this conflict is making crystal clear is that those means actually suck in practice.  Better safe than sorry, lets not help them.

1502188396097286147 2022-03-11 02:43:17 -0400 <AleksandrVoinov> Astonished that #Russia is still not too dirty/toxic for @DeutscheBank - even Goldman Sachs is pulling out. Well they also like Trumpski so supporting fascist and authoritarians is just something Deutsche Bank does.

1503186171316244481 2022-03-13 21:48:05 -0400 <csurubio> Today on a thanksgiving #Sunday, we must give thanks to the @WhiteHouse for one of the most irrational decisions ever; their ability to invite #Russia to be a member of the security council at @UN .

1502021660202864655 2022-03-10 15:40:44 -0400 <Australianspin2> @RT_com So cutting ties with Russia only dropped share prices by 2.3%. That’s worth every percent.

Is the propaganda easier to identify with? Who are we as a people if we allowed this to happen? Can we stop a madman before it's too late  Germans had to search decades

1502457858788450310 2022-03-11 20:34:02 -0400 <JVPehrson> @GOPLeader Why is the @GOP giving cover to #Putin? Why support #Russia rather than their own country?

1501886537600020480 2022-03-10 06:43:48 -0400 <ReconReporter> This is Russian propaganda at its best. No e-mail, no organization and always refer to the socialist comrades. Who runs along must be clear about: you support genocide. What received #Namibia from #Russia in the last 30 years? How much money from the West? Unbearable.

This means when @F1 season starts, @MercedesAMGF1 and @McLarenF1 would have logos on their cars and race suits of companies who SUPPORT Putin’s war/

1502005369236869125 2022-03-10 14:36:00 -0400 <PutinWarCrimes> Hey #Russia The rest of us on planet reality are pretty sure and 100% confident but just in case you weren't sure what evil Nazi war criminals look like. Here's a reminder.  https://t.co/NPvh7Vw5pE

1501940668863709184 2022-03-10 10:18:54 -0400 <MsBlueEarth2> Sounds like Russian citizens are being economically bombed back into the 1940s-50s.Goodbye honest media, credit cards, services and fast food....WAS THIS WORTH IT to dominate one democracy?  RISE UP, #Russia, remove your tyrant-dictator! He's guilty of war crimes; don't conspire!

1502288169248641026 2022-03-11 09:19:45 -0400 <JoaoPCSAlves> Are these sanctions towards #Russia or towards #middleClass Citizens? Because I’m not seeing the war stopping, but my money is worth les and less every day!

1502681167681798144 2022-03-12 11:21:23 -0400 <24Febbraio> #Russia (#China) elites play the smart ass on the geopolitical and economy maps. Then why are #Russian citizens grabbing as many #USD and #EUR as they can, for what it is allowed? Isn't that the enemy currency? R: Everybody knows how it will go and who will pay at the end

1502278900235264007 2022-03-11 08:42:55 -0400 <joshuadhughes> If true, these conclusions make clear that #Russia continues to face serious logistical and operational issues that will make its advance more costly and time-intensive:

1502204317868171269 2022-03-11 03:46:33 -0400 <monkey_viral> #Russia Is Having Less Success at Spreading Social Media Disinformation is now trending on  https://t.co/5BMUgS7r1O  https://t.co/5BMUgS7r1O

1501609265156526083 2022-03-09 12:22:02 -0400 <Hvaldimir1> Flying the #Soviet flag is the most pathetic ploy for attention yet. Clearly calling to domestic audiences who, seeing nothing redeeming in modern #Russia, want to recreate an idealized fiction of the past.  Cynical and unimaginative PR at best.

1503146939373830151 2022-03-13 19:12:12 -0400 <irinatsukerman_> Not accurate. #KSA has made it very clear that it's open to taking up #Biden on his request IF he addresses their #security concern. #KSA doesn't have much to gain from #Russia. #UAE has overplayed its hands a little with #Russia, but would still prefer working with US.

Sanctions do nothing but hurt poor people here who can't afford the higher costs those sanctions directly cause.  It also, does not hurt russia.

1503052803652079617 2022-03-13 12:58:08 -0400 <JanBilling1> How should - after such crimes - any 'peace agreement' be signed? The minute #Russian troops leave the occupied territory, all the war crimes will be visible. So, only 'peace' without #Russia retreating? This would be just an occupation.

1502999042665730048 2022-03-13 09:24:30 -0400 <GollingerH> @Times It’s hard to like Western world leaders who make decisions solely based on their own selfish energy needs? What is @NATO anyway, just a myth or a real power to be reckoned with by rogue nations like #Russia?

1502485581250633731 2022-03-11 22:24:12 -0400 <JDStunda> The Biden Administration is now asking Elon Musk to literally turn off all Teslas in #Russia. Now do you see their plans for you in the future? You don’t accept their policies or plans? … turn off your car, your internet, your phone etc.

1502149149734567945 2022-03-11 00:07:20 -0400 <JLynnFraser1> Grappling with Putin's Russia - Is Putin right in claiming #Russia reps conflicting set of #cultural values from  Western ones?

1501987172588523525 2022-03-10 13:23:42 -0400 <Kai_M17> Ok so, @cnn REPORTS "the #AmericanPeople don't mind paying higher #gasprices as long ad #Russia is held #accountable ."

1501621410728402951 2022-03-09 13:10:17 -0400 <MonicaLMarks> Marc’s investigations into fake Twitter accounts supporting #Russia &amp; more are invariably fascinating &amp; entertaining. They’re also extremely important, bc reading them equips us w/ tools to spot fakes ourselves &amp; knowledge that these (likely gov-sponsored) fakes are *everywhere.*

1502572211005272065 2022-03-12 04:08:26 -0400 <wakeupbritain_> How dumb are #russia? all you had to do is walk in and take everything without firing a gun.

1503349484134227974 2022-03-14 08:37:02 -0400 <___A_n_d_r_e_w_> Of all the ill I’ve thought of the @GOP, I never imagined I’d see the day it became a western mouthpiece for #Russia. But here we are. From @TuckerCarlson to this clod, the #Russian government couldn’t have asked for a better inroad to American opinion. Who needs internet trolls?

1503120560489996291 2022-03-13 17:27:22 -0400 <Florenc00526929> I have read reports that #Russia is now asking #China for military assistance in the form of military products.  I doubt China will give them any directly, but they have already adopted VERY favourable import laws for Russia.  If the report is true, it’s of concern.

1503103185258381316 2022-03-13 16:18:20 -0400 <AveryFarman> @TuckerCarlson - not just #1 with @GOP, but #1 with #Russia, too.  #MAGA-lovers, please, figure out you're being used by these folks.

1502863878631436291 2022-03-12 23:27:25 -0400 <CouncilW9> @joncoopertweets No. But if I hear a company is not pulling out of #Russia I definitely will NOT buy their products.

1502840446204059650 2022-03-12 21:54:18 -0400 <saptak81> Completely personal take, the sanctions now #Russia is putting back on #West clearly shuffles the world fin powers &amp; very soon #India will be in top  4...also positive on #indian markets, FIIs will have no way but to invest back here... Let's see how it goes.

1502807328139186177 2022-03-12 19:42:42 -0400 <moonrakerkih> @ntrickett16 With #China and #India backing #Putin and looking to increase trade in #Russia, that will inevitably include to fill voids left by sanctions. Putin is at his weakest right now but he will grow stronger. If #NATO is going to act, it needs to do so now.

1502449405164728322 2022-03-11 20:00:27 -0400 <Real_me2030> How time overshadowed events, but the truth will always be there.   #Russia Vs #USA

Just not land in mineral rights yet. But between the traitorous Democrat backdoor policies, having shell companies.. it's probably happening just as sure as we gave uranium to #Russia

1502331516977917953 2022-03-11 12:12:00 -0400 <jgreality> @nexta_tv By years US and #EU basically fund the "enemy" buying cheap from #Russia and #China. Now they want to revert years of economy and pretend everything it's gonna be ok and that they will win. But sanctions can backfire and if they do. Deflation and mass scarcity will come.

1502193599563370497 2022-03-11 03:03:58 -0400 <YD4Gfrp2kszKL3j> @JosepStalinCCCP @TranslatorBot2k That is why #Russia reacted in this way, paradoxically and completely unorthodoxly, but it had to somehow support its position geodynamically. The #Ukrainian government knew and hid many of its plans from the #Ukrainianpeople, it is responsible.. (6)

One caveat, alas: "in full" will be a huge problem. #Russia won't give up #Crimea and insist of the "independence" of the 2 rebel republics. We need to address that honestly. My take - peace is still worth it, and it won't get any better now anyhow.

It was always either an act of "liberation" or a fight with nazists.

1503026786803851269 2022-03-13 11:14:45 -0400 <nadroj47> So #EdwardSnowden was a traitor to his country and accused of #treason but @TuckerCarlson is basically helping #russia and nothing happens to him. Why don’t we get the real #traitors and people committing #treason.

1502940695530721280 2022-03-13 05:32:39 -0400 <ilya_sadowsky> Interestingly, #Russia has not yet imposed retaliatory sanctions, and the European Union is not only reaping the fruits of its own decisions. What will happen when Russia imposes #sanctions.🤔

1501788077232201729 2022-03-10 00:12:34 -0400 <AurielDaniel> If #Russia defaults (which seems likely now), it could spark a global #recession. It is still a “could” but everyone should start (re)considering their plans and prepare #contingency measures. Be careful out there.

Oil fields that require thechnologies that US won't export? Russia is only valuable in the context of good relations with us/ US/ EU.

1502258397416144898 2022-03-11 07:21:27 -0400 <tokoraki1> This is totally true! #Russia is not an imperialist state, it is a colonialist state because it does not only invades a country but also moves its population there

1503279232251838464 2022-03-14 03:57:53 -0400 <grynova_CCC> @Boris_Maryasin I realise that it takes great bravery to protest in #russia. But: 1. #Ukrainians are being shot dead, not detained. 2. Imagine if all of Moscow, millions went to streets, like the people in Berdyansk.

1502282600391524358 2022-03-11 08:57:37 -0400 <JasonRGrieve> Why would anyone EVER travel to Russia after this?  How can Russia get away with this?  I hope the world boycotts travel to Russia for years to come. #Russia

1502221774842474497 2022-03-11 04:55:55 -0400 <BlackQueenLara> @medialens @BBCNews I worked TO END the war in Syria for 3 years, and #Putin saved #Syria when he came in ONLY in 2015 or 2016 cause Syria and #Russia had a signed agreement, still valid 6 decades. The Syrian War was caused by  USA, Europe &amp; Israel using Rebels. 1 month ago, Putin was the BEST one.

The reason the military won't allow civilians to take charge, I am told, is the mines and oil fields. I now get it. Well!

1502705988985507840 2022-03-12 13:00:01 -0400 <IliyaKusa> This is one of two ways on how the #US are trying to find way to curb #Russia oil &amp; gas exports.   The other way is to speed up #Iran nuclear deal negotiations in Vienna so as to allow their oil into market.   With this #Venezuela news I have one question: what about Juan Guaido?

1502096266855026688 2022-03-10 20:37:12 -0400 <rejectfear> What ever happened to the divide and conquer strategy?

1501479184253652992 2022-03-09 03:45:08 -0400 <VpNambi> KFC, Pepsi, Coca Cola, McDonald’s have stopped their sales in #Russia. What are they trying to achieve? An obesity-free, healthy Russia?

1503058285209006091 2022-03-13 13:19:55 -0400 <marekjanous> I’m under growing impression that #Putin is deliberately angling at pulling #NATO into the war. It would help him with domestic #propaganda. Since NATO would never invade #Russia’s territory, or strike it massively, Russia could never lose a “defensive war” against NATO.

1501614493494775810 2022-03-09 12:42:48 -0400 <ElizIdler> Hello #MariaZakharova it’s not a Russophobia but about not accepting #Russia wrong doing. Against the killing of civilians and innocent children. Is about defending #Ukrainians right to live peacefully in their land. It’s about you mind your own business

1502171960830091264 2022-03-11 01:37:59 -0400 <EpdnSFOak> @antonioguterres If @UN was doing its job, there would not be growing refugees. The solution for this war is having all at the negotiation table. When this organization has become so ineffective at peaceful resolution, it has outlived its true purpose. #NATO #Russia need a DMZ area

1502445524401770500 2022-03-11 19:45:01 -0400 <jimwitkins> Good luck with that. Gonna find Russia even more isolated. Don't expect the companies to return.

1503067809684860932 2022-03-13 13:57:46 -0400 <jakluge> As a result of the war, trust in #Putin is soaring to 77.4% in #Russia. Source is a state pollster and surveys in autocracies are problematic, but the relative change is credible. When foreign policy becomes the key issue, the government always benefits in Russia initially. [1/2]  https://t.co/jvLSqeicYw

1502044528680833028 2022-03-10 17:11:36 -0400 <mpalmond> It is amazing even in an age of shallow strategic twittering that anyone thinks #Napoleon's sending of of #Polish lancers across the #Niemen in #1812 to invade #Russia is a stirring model to emulate. #Putin' war is going badly but it looks like genius compared to an 1812 rerun.

1501600746684440576 2022-03-09 11:48:11 -0400 <jseldin> #Russia's "moderate progress" near #Kharkiv &amp; elsewhere - "They have mass on their side. They simply have more forces than the #Ukrainians do" per senior US defense official   "But they're meeting w/a stiff resistance...particularly in Kharkiv"

1501928371592257536 2022-03-10 09:30:02 -0400 <cliveldunn> Let's face it the money is not as important as the underlying commodities it gives access to. Hitler invaded #Russia to access them. Didn't work out so well.

1501820665812463618 2022-03-10 02:22:03 -0400 <GillJohnson6> The British government is a total embarrassment. The only people we welcomed were #Oligarchs from #Russia with no checks or scrutiny.

1502723689564934149 2022-03-12 14:10:21 -0400 <GoodMenzo> @Alex_D_1985 @abzgla @somogyianthony @joelockhart @grandmagrit @BBC A lie told many times over does not make it true even though some may think so. In #Russia information is controlled by government and moreover #Putin. He set the truth however he want$ it to be. This is not Truth. Truth is free of tamper and silencing. The truth is in silence.

1503086849048334339 2022-03-13 15:13:25 -0400 <andy_zelleke> @ElbridgeColby From narrow US national interest perspective, all of #Europe falling to #Russia (true, extremely unlikely--tho a risk-happy, desperate #Putin waving nukes is novel scenario) would be *even worse* (for global power balance *vis-a-vis #China*) than CN taking #Taiwan.2

1501640710096838666 2022-03-09 14:26:59 -0400 <UlamawPaxo> Hey, #Germany  So you feel guilt before #russia after #WW2.  Yeah, please continue, until we all find ourselves in the middle of #WW3

Plus he has no offical desgination or assignment to negotiate with #Russia from either @Bundeskanzler nor @spdde. Just a poor man's friar's latern IMHO 🙄

1502418809352859649 2022-03-11 17:58:52 -0400 <Truthbetoldact> The kind of sanctions done on #Russia &amp; #Russian oligarchs can force the Ethiopian government allow trucks to #Tigray. Until trucks are allowed, air delivery &amp; airdrop remains to be the only option. Yes it is more costly than trucking; but each air delivery saves 1000's of lives.

1501583178737274884 2022-03-09 10:38:22 -0400 <flyover_patriot> Only 8% of our oil imports come from Russia. Our ban will not hurt Russia. It’s mainly symbolic. It shouldn’t hurt us. That’s 8% Not a reason to jack up gas prices so much. It’s a ploy to push expensive electrical vehicles. #ev #Oil #russia

1503331035668307972 2022-03-14 07:23:44 -0400 <lettywho1> Who will meet #Iran's #JCPOA demands? - Iran isn't speaking directly with US. - E3 reps returned home; said their job is done. - #Russia threw a monkey wrench at #ViennaTalks. - #Biden team spews hope but US anti-Iran actions tell a different story. - While China sits on fence.

1503039387021582346 2022-03-13 12:04:49 -0400 <IranWonk> @MichaelSinghDC US-E3/EU sanctioning #Iran over economic ties w/ #Russia - basically vetoing strategic relationship - would be seen as a bad precedent allowing West to erode #JCPOA benefits on "non-nuclear" grounds. So if deal doesn't fail over this it might still become recurring issue.

1502974616008019975 2022-03-13 07:47:27 -0400 <MikTukhachevsky> @olex_scherba I remember when, during the #Russia'n-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the useful idiots in democratic states defended the invasion (and suppression) as "unfortunate" but "necessary" because of "Western interference."  They have not changed.

1502648080075997184 2022-03-12 09:09:54 -0400 <karankv_> #Russia offers more oil to India. Basic strategy of appeasement by big powers to take sides in the recent tussel between West and @Russia.

1501651728957124608 2022-03-09 15:10:46 -0400 <IzabelaCzyewsk4> Why the only European leader with balls is Ukrainian? Aren’t there any more men around to help fight #Russia?

1501512097292865539 2022-03-09 05:55:55 -0400 <theforeverman> Not good enough, where are the calls for sanctions? They are ready enough on the command of their US/Israeli bribers and blackmailers to do it to #Russia, now how about #Israel...? #CapeTown #SouthAfrica

1503169975019884549 2022-03-13 20:43:44 -0400 <s_black76> Fossil fuels- why? Because that's the infrastructure that is available now.

1502605582913744902 2022-03-12 06:21:02 -0400 <ParkLukaseu> My impression is also that a completely different understanding of #NationalSocialism prevails in #Russia. Not #Shoa and concentration camps are main, but lightning intrusion into national identity oppression.

1502334570145869825 2022-03-11 12:24:08 -0400 <MonilParikh> ⭐️ Currently #Russia sell around US$ 700 million worth of Oil &amp; Gas to #Europe daily which constitute 75% of its total export.  • Russia is trying to reduce dependence on Europe by it’s new pipeline to China but it will be only 30% of that gas supply to EU.

1501799602298802176 2022-03-10 00:58:21 -0400 <DOGMA_ATOMICUS> Many many nations within the Russian federation are upset with #colonizers.    I mean they hate the people who colonized North America with a passion.  #Russia at war with almost every country that invaded our lands. But Russia never spilled indigenous blood.  A TRUTH to this.

1502063865315708930 2022-03-10 18:28:27 -0400 <BattousaiVu> @Back_dafucup Eastern Europe countries should form an alliance instead of depending on #Nato. Decades of peace make the #US #UK #EU weak. Putin has already won due to the indecisiveness of the West. Sanctions aren't effective since #China has a trade pact with #Russia.

1501900370716598275 2022-03-10 07:38:46 -0400 <EtalSpot> Why is it that the Bank of China has stopped extending credit to #Putin but @Citi is still doing business in #Russia?

1501685063771168768 2022-03-09 17:23:13 -0400 <HarrisSamaras> #Russia has decided to ban raw materials to the #West for up until the end of the year, but list not yet announced.  #China is laughing its heart out, and #Europe - still divided despite the rhetoric and the fireworks - is scared shitless, but more, it is afraid to admit it. 5/10

1501568358596194310 2022-03-09 09:39:29 -0400 <SolidSombra> By the way, the humiliation of a person for being Russian is called Nazism or fascism. It didn't die. It has always been in Europe and America. It's just that until this day they "successfully fought" with this.  #Russophobia #Russia

It’s always in a struggle to live up to these aspirations, but it can’t, because the West has always been more powerful #Russia

1502271734959026183 2022-03-11 08:14:27 -0400 <asari_kamisama> Europe is definitely imposing sanctions against Russia? I'm not sure anymore... #Russia #UE #RussianUkrainianWar  https://t.co/CVYEcRcGHz

1502274789578362881 2022-03-11 08:26:35 -0400 <H_Gibbs_Bauer> There needs to be a way out of this trap for #Russia as well. Obviously, they can’t join #OPERATIONMERLINGUA, but in the event hostilities cease, we can explore possibilities for energy-development financing on the same favorable terms we offer to other energy-exporting nations.

1502675521796202509 2022-03-12 10:58:57 -0400 <PutinIsAVirus> So, basically, to stop / seize the #yacht of a #Russia oligarch, the vessel has to be within the territorial waters of a country which approved those sanctions (or allied with one that does).

1503145550413131776 2022-03-13 19:06:40 -0400 <noir90210> China faces consequences if it helps Russia evade sanctions, U.S. says. @XHNews @PDChina #China would have to be an idiot to help #Russia evade sanctions. Nothing is worth the $3 trillion China trade surplus. Vladivostok must be returned to China first.   https://t.co/HMXuMRksFa

1503136864471072769 2022-03-13 18:32:10 -0400 <catherinerowett> Dear Mr Johnson, When we say we don't want oil or gas from #Russia, we don't mean go and beg for oil from another criminal country instead. No, we don't want #Saudi oil either thanks. We want the renewable energy and home insulation that you should have been prioritising anyway.

They will draw up a declaration emphasising stronger investments in European #defence. Much needed, given the increased threat that #Russia poses to #European #security. Likely that Article 42.7 will also be discussed.

1502217703393841152 2022-03-11 04:39:45 -0400 <TheLastPitStop> #FoxNews. Truly amazing. The #USA yet not lost soul completely. The Postwest facilitated &amp; instigated #WW3 is about to turn into inter-Postwest all-against-all clusterfuck chaos. #Russia will not come to save you again, won't help you out.  https://t.co/9c9zBvNwJ6

1503354919763562497 2022-03-14 08:58:38 -0400 <YanniKouts> US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan: "We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to #Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world." /via @Reuters ↓ UAE, Turkey and China listening?

1501945811319476230 2022-03-10 10:39:20 -0400 <SphereByMilan> Remember &amp; #NeverForget who are the assholes like these that voted FOR #Russia then when times come make them pay the piper no matter their BS excuses ... I'm not surprised by #GOPTraitorsToDemocracy but oh yeah I am looking at both of you duplicitous POS @IlhanMN &amp; @CoriBush

1501589901535440902 2022-03-09 11:05:05 -0400 <Linda__Stevens> @ZarayskayaYulia @Spatial_Punk @Mapbox NO, they don't. Why @Esri is flagrantly ignoring the fact that #Esri #Russia is still providing #GIS to Russia is astounding. Do you know what #GIS is good at? Targeting POI by location.

1502023646625386499 2022-03-10 15:48:38 -0400 <TimothyCalkins> This is weak language from #Uniqlo...shutting down in #Russia due to "a number of difficulties"? The brand should join most of the great brands of the world: reject the #war and stop doing business in #Russia. @UniqloUSA    https://t.co/Bn2PAOkLEn

1502329413014368257 2022-03-11 12:03:38 -0400 <theb1ackswan> #Oil prices rose Friday but were still headed for a weekly decline as traders weighed headlines around #Russia and Iran suggesting more possible supply disruptions, versus those promising remedies in a tight market. -Reuters

1502746115279622145 2022-03-12 15:39:28 -0400 <IamNOTcrazy__> Without #SovietUnion #Europe would have economic growth not only in the West but also in the East Europe..#Russia only cause problems to East Europe nations&amp; oppress those nations which they want a better future away from authoritarian countries which their mind stuck in the past

1502628251210076166 2022-03-12 07:51:07 -0400 <seanedwardfitz> For the crime of being #Russian. Hearing speculation that #Russia will be kicked out of #Eurovision2022. This is becoming just like how Japanese U.S. citizens were rounded up after the Pearl Harbour attack for the crime of being Japanese, but were suppose to be the "good guys".🤔

1502199549036691456 2022-03-11 03:27:36 -0400 <kachoraz> @hsfi @dagensnyheter &amp; @politiken announced they will print info in Russian, 2 help fight military censorship by #Russia, but they conveniently forgot that #EuropeanUnion started massive #censorship targetting all #Russian news outlets &amp; portals. #Shameless European #Hypocrites

1502102239716196352 2022-03-10 21:00:56 -0400 <alphahistory> For centuries sanctions have been used as a tool of war and external pressure. But as Siobhan Talbott explains with reference to the 18th century, imposing stringent sanctions is much easier than upholding and enforcing them. #history #sanctions #russia   https://t.co/e2XLIT3r7m  https://t.co/vNdNHChEKO

1501935914376830989 2022-03-10 10:00:01 -0400 <StatistaCharts> The list of companies that have announced their withdrawal or suspension of activities in #Russia continues to grow. @McDonalds announced the closure of nearly 850 restaurants on Tuesday but will retain its 62,000 employees. How do you think this will impact Russia's economy?

1502248088060284930 2022-03-11 06:40:29 -0400 <OmarKamel> What Russian citizens are learning:   1. Use Samsung, Not Apple.  2. Steal Movies and Shows from Torrents, Don't Subscribe to Netflix.  3. Never use Western Banks.  4. Never use Western Credit Cards or Apple Pay.  5. Download Pirated Copies of Adobe apps.   Etc.  #Russia #Russian

1501686712845889537 2022-03-09 17:29:46 -0400 <PUBB_UK> Reluctantly @CaterpillarInc suspends its manufacturing operations in #Russia, which means that exports to Russia or Belarus are not affected #bloodmoney #ESG #BoycottRussia  https://t.co/uTyExhERcu

1501607732503273472 2022-03-09 12:15:56 -0400 <RegistryReport> The west SHOULD #boycott #Russia. But for some, it's not just a matter of not selling products to Russia. For companies like @HiltonHotels @Marriott or @Hyatt, the decision to shut down dozens of billion dollar hotels &amp; putting thousands of people out of work isn't an easy one.  https://t.co/mSFWafR1vX

1501530871471525891 2022-03-09 07:10:31 -0400 <GroganFran> @YardleyShooting You're supporting the very authorities that have ruined our lives for the last few years and plan to make them a lot worst ( #GreatReset ) by asking them to #sanction #Russia. Not to mention punishing millions of innocent #Russian civilians.

1501646638284259340 2022-03-09 14:50:32 -0400 <kicker6741> @TaraJeffrey @Shell_Canada @ACCESS_OM So... let's put huge pressure on workers to not report incidents. You don't want to be the one who causes @ACCESS_OM to miss out on $1K. It's no wonder that #Shell thought it was OK to buy oil from #Russia

1502276994788167681 2022-03-11 08:35:21 -0400 <chriscartw83> A truly indecent article in the #guardian @guardian   Opposing economic sanctions againt #russia   You can now forget asking for my financial support, going forward   Go and ask russian #oligarchs  Really sickening 🤮🤮🤮🤮 I ended financing this..😭   https://t.co/SLiYDnffXs
